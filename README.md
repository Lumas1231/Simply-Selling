# Simply-Selling
🧩 What Problem Does It Solve?
New Zealand’s real estate industry is dominated by commission-based agents who typically charge 2–4% of the sale price — often amounting to $20,000–$40,000+ per sale, plus additional fees for marketing and legal support. Simply Selling aims to disrupt this outdated model by:

Eliminating agent commissions entirely

Offering clear flat-fee pricing

Providing full-service tools and support to sellers — all through a single platform

💡 How It Works
Simply Selling guides sellers through every stage of the home sale, combining automation and professional support:

Instant Property Valuation

Pick a Package — Basic, Standard, or Premium

Book Professional Services — photos, staging, building reports, etc.

Create & Launch Listings — on Trade Me, OneRoof, Homes.co.nz

Manage Open Homes & Offers — via a seller dashboard

Negotiate and Settle — with access to legal professionals when needed

🔧 Platform Features
Centralised Dashboard to manage every step of the sale

Booking tools for photography, staging, etc.

Offer and counteroffer system

Legal and conveyancing access included or optional, depending on package

Document uploads and secure file handling via Amazon S3

Automated workflows using tools like Buildship and Xano

📦 Packages & Pricing
Packages are priced from around $5,000 to $9,000 all-in, which includes:

Professional marketing

Legal services

LIM/Builder’s reports

A $2,000 flat platform fee (not a percentage of the sale)

This contrasts with traditional agent models that often exceed $30,000 in total costs for a $1 million home.

🧠 Differentiators
Not an agency, and not just DIY tools — Simply Selling is a complete guided system

Transparent pricing — every dollar explained

Modern design & branding — building trust through polish and professionalism

Decentralised delivery — leverages local service providers instead of employing staff

🎯 Target Market
Homeowners who want to avoid high commission fees

Investors who understand marketing value

DIY-savvy sellers who still want guidance

Regional sellers outside major cities (especially in early rollout like Pukekohe)

🚀 Growth Plan
Start with a manual MVP in Pukekohe

Scale across New Zealand via automated platform

Introduce buyer-side tools and eventually offer mortgage services



Based on the Simply Selling brand's positioning — sleek, modern, trust-building, tech-driven, and Kiwi-centric — here’s a recommended typography and colour scheme that aligns with your values and communicates professionalism, transparency, and approachability:

🎨 Colour Scheme: “Clean Confidence”
Purpose	Colour	Hex Code	Notes
Primary	Fresh Green	#2DBE60	Represents growth, savings, and Kiwi DIY culture. Bright and modern.
Secondary	Charcoal Black	#222222	Clean, modern contrast for text and UI elements. Serious but not harsh.
Accent 1	Light Emerald	#A1E8AF	Soft green for hover states, callouts, or price highlights. Adds approachability.
Accent 2	Sky White	#F9F9F9	Clean white background. Keeps UI fresh, open, and calming.
Alert/Highlight	Warm Orange	#FFA552	For CTAs, progress indicators, and attention prompts (e.g., “Make Offer”).

🔤 Typography System: “Modern Simplicity”
1. Primary Typeface: Inter
Modern, highly legible, and optimised for screens.

Open-source and perfect for no-code tools like Webflow and WeWeb.
